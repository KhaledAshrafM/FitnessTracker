# Fitness Tracker
=====================

## Introduction

Fitness Tracker is a machine learning-based project that classifies barbell exercises and counts repetitions using accelerometer and gyroscope data.

## Project Overview

This project aims to create a machine learning model that can accurately classify barbell exercises and count repetitions using data from accelerometers and gyroscopes.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

* Python 3.8 or higher
* Conda environment (recommended)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/KhaledAshrafM/FitnessTracker.git`
2. Create a new conda environment: `conda env create -f environment.yml`
3. Activate the environment: `conda activate tracking-barbell-exercises`

## Usage

### Running the Scripts

1. Navigate to the project directory: `cd FitnessTracker`
2. Run the script: `python script_name.py`

### Scripts

* `make_dataset.py`: Process accelerometer and gyroscope data
* `visualize.py`: Visualize processed data
